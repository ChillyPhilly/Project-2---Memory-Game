# Memory Game Project

## Summary

I have taken the skeleton from the Udacity repository and made it my own! Plenty of features have been added over time and I'm really proud of how it's come out in such a short amount of time.
#### Warning
*This game contains unreasonable levels of sass. Please be careful!*


### How to Play

1. Start the game by opening it in your favourite Google Chrome. (I mean really, why would you be using another browser?)
1. Click the tiles to turn them over, two at a time. When two are the same, you'll get a "Match" and they'll stay flipped over. Match all the tiles to keep them all flipped over at the same time, and win!
1. Dependencies:
